    "A cold breeze brushes your neck—there’s no wind, and you are very much underground.",
    "You push open a heavy door—it groans loudly, echoing like a complaint.",
    "The torchlight flickers as you descend a spiral staircase carved into the stone.",
    "Somewhere in the distance, you hear dripping water. And something else.",
    "You squeeze through a narrow passage, the stone walls damp and uncomfortably close.",
    "Dust hangs in the air, thick and undisturbed for ages... until now.",
    "You pass under a crumbling archway, barely holding itself together.",
    "Something scurries past your foot. You choose not to look.",
    "You step into a room where every sound you make seems swallowed by the darkness.",
    "A soft glow pulses from the wall ahead—faint, rhythmic, almost like breathing.",
    "You follow a trail of ancient symbols etched into the ground.",
    "The air smells of mold, metal, and secrets.",
    "You step onto a tiled floor—one tile sinks with a click.",
    "A strange humming sound fills your ears. No one else seems to hear it.",
    "You feel like you’ve been in this corridor before. But haven’t you been going straight?",
    "A distant scream echoes. Human? Not human? Better not to know.",
    "You feel watched. Not by eyes—but by the walls themselves.",
    "Your torch dims for a moment. The darkness feels… alive.",
    "The silence here is so thick it presses against your skin."

chest_discovery = [
    "You spot a chest in the corner—its lid slightly ajar, as if it’s been opened recently.",
    "Covered in cobwebs and sealed with a rusted lock, the old crate practically dares you to open it.",
    "A small, ornate box sits on a pedestal, glowing faintly with an eerie blue light.",
    "You find a treasure chest... sitting on top of a pressure plate. Classic.",
    "The crate looks ordinary—until it blinks at you.",
    "You open the box, and a puff of glittery smoke bursts out, smelling oddly like cinnamon.",
    "The chest groans as you pry it open, as if reluctant to reveal its secrets.",
    "There’s a note pinned to the lid: “Definitely not cursed.”",
    "A heavy, ironbound chest rests in the center of the room, untouched by dust. Suspiciously untouched.",
    "You reach for the lid, but the chest suddenly scuttles three steps back.",
    "Inside the wooden crate, you find... another smaller crate. Neatly labeled “Important.”",
    "The chest opens with a dramatic creak, revealing a single sock. It’s glowing.",
    "The box is locked tight, but you notice fresh scratches around the keyhole. Someone else tried.",
    "You lift the lid, and dozens of eyes blink up at you. Then vanish.",
    "As soon as you open the chest, a loud trumpet sound plays from nowhere. Dramatic much?",
    "You brush the dust off a metal coffer—engraved with runes that rearrange themselves when touched.",
    "It’s not locked, but something about the silence around the chest makes you hesitate.",
    "You find a small chest tucked under a pile of bones. The bones weren’t human. Probably.",
    "You open the lid and find... your own name carved inside.",
    "The chest is empty—but you definitely saw something move inside before you opened it."

meeting = [
    "You feel eyes on you, but when you turn, there's nothing but shadows.",
    "A low, wet sound echoes through the corridor... and it’s getting closer.",
    "You freeze mid-step—the silence around you is suddenly *too* complete.",
    "Something shifts just beyond the range of your torchlight.",
    "You hear a slow dragging noise from behind the wall... then silence.",
    "A shadow detaches itself from the corner and moves—against the light.",
    "There’s a faint breathing sound up ahead. It stops the moment you notice it.",
    "Your foot nudges something soft on the floor. It twitches.",
    "You spot fresh footprints in the dust—*very* fresh.",
    "The hairs on the back of your neck rise as you step into the chamber. You’re not alone.",
    "You hear a single metallic clink. Then another. Then... nothing.",
    "The air here is warmer. And it smells... wrong.",
    "You swear you saw something at the end of the hall—but now it’s gone.",
    "A distant hiss slithers through the silence, just low enough to doubt if it was real.",
    "Your torch flickers twice—on the third flicker, something stands where nothing was before.",
    "You round a corner and come face to face with— *nothing*. But the dread in your gut says otherwise.",
    "A deep growl reverberates from the walls. Or was it the ceiling?",
    "A whisper brushes past your ear, though no one is there. It said... your name.",
    "The floor ahead is scorched. Still warm.",
    "You blink, and when your vision clears, the room has changed. And you’re not alone anymore."

    "Candles glow on the walls, their flames undisturbed by any breeze.",
    "A table stands set with bread and fruit—fresh, untouched, and oddly inviting.",
    "The air is warm, the silence soft. Even your wounds seem to ache a little less here.",
    "An old fireplace crackles in the corner, though there's no sign of who lit it.",
    "You step into the room and exhale. You hadn't realized how tense you'd been.",
    "A soft lullaby seems to hum from the stones themselves.",
    "You find a hammock gently swaying, as if it’s been waiting for someone.",
    "There’s a kettle resting over a fire. It begins to whistle just as you arrive.",
    "The walls are carved with peaceful scenes—forests, stars, a sleeping dragon.",
    "You sit, and for the first time in what feels like days, nothing tries to kill you.",
    "A faint, familiar melody plays somewhere in the room—one from your childhood, maybe?",
    "You step into the chamber, and for a brief moment, it feels like home.",
    "The room smells like lavender and old parchment. It feels safe.",
    "A stack of thick, cozy blankets rests in the corner. They look absurdly clean.",
    "You hear soft snoring. A friendly-looking cat naps on a pile of pillows.",

    "A circle of runes surrounds a small pool of silver liquid—its surface perfectly still.",
    "A floating orb spins slowly in the air, casting rainbow-colored reflections on the walls.",
    "The moment you enter, the room reacts—glyphs ignite across the floor in a slow, pulsing rhythm.",
    "You discover an altar covered in vines that bloom with glowing flowers as you approach.",
    "A mirror stands alone in the room, but your reflection smiles before you do.",
    "You reach a chamber bathed in twilight, though no sun could possibly shine here.",
    "In the center of the room, a sword floats, point down, embedded in nothing at all.",
    "The fountain’s waters glow with a soft green light, and the scent of spring fills the air.",
    "A spiral staircase leads nowhere—until you step onto it, and it begins to move.",
    "As you approach the pool, glowing fish dart through the air above it like birds.",
    "The room is filled with books that turn their own pages slowly, as if browsing themselves.",
    "You touch the stone wall, and it sings softly in a language you almost understand.",
    "A beam of light shines down from nowhere, illuminating a chalice that seems untouched by time.",
    "The air is thick with sparkles, and when you inhale, you briefly remember a dream you once forgot.",
    "A set of footprints—glowing faintly—lead across the room, and vanish into the wall.",
    "At the center lies a giant egg, cracked open. Whatever was inside left behind a trail of stardust.",
